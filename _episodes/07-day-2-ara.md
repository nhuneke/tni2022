### Advert 

 

Now you get to put what you have learned into action!  

 

We would like you to develop an idea for a translational neuroimaging research project. You can choose anything which interests you. You can use any imaging modality you wish. 

 

We suggest you work in groups of 3-4 (change depending on number of attendees).  

 

Work in your team to prepare a short pitch of no more than 5 minutes. You may use slides if you wish, but this is not necessary. 

 

The judging panel will consider all the pitches and award prizes.  

 

### Hints: 

 * Have fun and work together! 

 * Make your pitch stick to the allotted time. 

 * Start with a clear research question. Pick something which interests you. If may be something we have discussed in the course, or something which you have thought yourself. If you are struggling to come up with an idea, chat to the teachers who will help you develop your thoughts. 

 * Give a little background on what is already known on your chosen topic. 

 * Think about what processes you want to study, and which neuroimaging modality would be best. 

 * Consider all the steps in the data pipeline, from acquisition to analysis. 

 * Identify any weak points in your plan and discuss strategies to mitigate these. 

 * Finally, think about what impact your results would have. What would be your next steps?
