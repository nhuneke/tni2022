## Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)

**Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)** is the brain injury caused by the lack of oxygen supply, likely due to interruption of the oxygenated blood flow to the brain. The mechanisms of brain injury after hypoxia-ischemia occur in several phases [[Davidson et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2021.101267)]:

 1. *Primary* phase:
 2. *Latent* phase: cerebral oxidative metabolism may recover to control levels, partially or even completely. Significantly increased level of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX, cytochrome C, and Caspase-8, at 3 and 6 hours after hypoxia-ischemia.
 3. *Secondary* phase: programmed cell death is a common endpoint in pathways of brain injury following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. Delayed onset of seizures is a major pathophysiological event. 
 4. *Tertiary* phase: persisting and ongoing effects on the brain after about 72 hours after the primary injury. This includes sensitization to inflammation or injury, increased seizure susceptibility, persistent inflammation and gliosis, impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, altered proliferation and synaptogenesis, and epigenetic alterations.
 
An overview of the different phases of the mechanisms is illustrated below [[Davidson et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2021.101267)]:

**Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH)** reduce cerebral metabolic demand by lowering the temperature, therefore improve neurological recovery and reduce mortality.

Newborns with neonatal HIE without proper treatment (such as TH) may develop **Cerebral Palsy (CP)**, which is a movement disorder caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain.

### So, what is the *problem*?

Newborn babies who had HIE at birth and underwent TH and without CP, typically showed no sign of injury on conventional MRI in later development. However, these children were reported to have neurocognitive deficits at school-age [[Annink et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83982-8)].

### How can MRI help?

**Conventional T1- and T2-weighted imaging**

**Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)**

**Magentic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)**

**Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)**

**Arterial spin labelling (ASL)**
